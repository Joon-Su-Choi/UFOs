# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project focuses on building a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. To the webpage we have added table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

**Main Page**

This is the main page the user first sees. The user can re-initialize the page by clicking the navbar at the top left where it says "UFO Sightings".

## Summary

- Overall the webpage shows basic functionality but a foreseeable drawback is that the user might not know what parameters to use for filtering such as not knowing the name of a particular city or the description of shapes as they are not predescribed or listed as options (Ex: The shape of "light" or "formation" may not come to mind.)

- A recommendation for this drawback would be to include a drop down options list. For filters such as the locations and shape, there are only a finite amount of these options so putting down these predetermined parameters would be beneficial.

- Another recommendation would be to add options to look for a range in the date's filter. This would aid in particular dates of sighting one might look for with ease as opposed to looking at multiple pages.
